# FIJI_ColorblindCheck
Two scripts to let you check the colorblind-friendliness of your figures/images. 

colorblindmontage.ijm is a FIJI macro that will make a montage of all available 
phenotypes of colorblindness available in FIJI's native colorblindness simulator. 

CBsimActionTool.ijm is a script that you can paste into your FIJI startupmacro.ijm 
script to run the colorblindmontage.ijm script with the click of a button on your
FIJI GUI.
